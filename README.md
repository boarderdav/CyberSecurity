CyberSecurity Project
ODU MBA Project - IT 695
Professor: Dr. Harris Wu

## Overview

This is a project for Cyber Security for my IT 695 class.  The assignment was to create a website and instructions on the awareness of common Cyber Security threats.  The website can be viewed through my gh-pages branch @ http://boarderdav.github.io/CyberSecurity/

## Code Example

I used new IDE called Intellij IDEA to code this new website example.  I previously used tools like Dreamweaver and SublimeText but found much better performance with Intellij.
